# Quantum Mechanics Simulations (Python)

This repository contains Python programs implementing **numerical and simulation-based approaches** to foundational problems in quantum mechanics.  
The emphasis is on solving quantum systems where analytical solutions are limited or require numerical support.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Quantum bound-state problems:
  - Particle in a potential well
  - Quantum harmonic oscillator
- Eigenvalue and eigenfunction computation
- Hydrogen atom–related calculations
- Time-independent Schrödinger equation (numerical solutions)
- Quantum decay and dynamical behavior
- Effects of disorder and perturbations

## 🧠 Focus of the Repository

- Numerical solution of quantum mechanical equations
- Visualization of wavefunctions and probability densities
- Studying energy spectra and eigenstates
- Bridging analytical quantum mechanics with computation

The code prioritizes **physical interpretation**, not just numerical output.
